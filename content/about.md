You can find my CV [here](/documents/CV.pdf) (Current as of 11/13/2024).

Hello, my name is James Oswald! I am PhD student at [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute](https://rpi.edu/) and graduate researcher with the [The Rensselaer Artificial Intelligence and Reasoning (RAIR) Laboratory](https://rair.cogsci.rpi.edu/), under [Professor Selmer Bringsjord](https://homepages.rpi.edu/~brings/). My primary research interest is in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), that is, how we can best create single AI agents that perform well on general tasks. The rest of my research interests such as machine learning, modal logic, and cognitive architectures all stem from my interest in AGI design. 

Before I was a PhD student at RPI, I was an undergraduate computer science and mathematics dual major at [The State University of New York at Albany (SUNY Albany)](https://www.albany.edu/), where I worked as an undergraduate researcher under [Professor Petko Bogdanov](http://www.cs.albany.edu/~petko/lab/petko-bogdanov) in the [Data Mining and Management Laboratory](http://www.cs.albany.edu/~petko/lab/) doing machine learning research. I also served as the chair of the [SUNY Albany IEEE Student chapter](https://ieeeualbany.org/), which I still actively participate in as a member of the Board of Trustees.

### Research Interests
* [Artificial General Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence): How can we build AI systems that perform well on a range of tasks rather than single ("narrow") tasks? 
* [Logic Based Artificial Intelligence](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-ai/): How can we create AI agents that can perform complex reasoning and generate explanations of their reasoning?
  * [Many Dimensional Modal Logics](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/phil-multimodallogic/): What are the best underlying representations for modality in AI systems? How can we have AI systems reason about obligation, possibility, belief, time, and ontology in a real time computationally feasible manner? 
  * [Automated Reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_reasoning)
  * [Automated Planning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_planning_and_scheduling)
* [Machine Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning): Can we integrate strong advances in machine learning for natural language processing and computer vision with logic based AI agents to produce general purpose hybrid agents?
  * [Large Language Models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model)
* [Cognitive Architectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_architecture): Can we create intelligent agents through computational models of parts of the human mind?
