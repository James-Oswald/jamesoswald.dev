### Background
Recently, I attended my first opera: a showing of *La bohème* at the Metropolitan. While I wasn't supper impressed with the plot, I brought a copy of *First-Order Modal Logic* by Mendelsohn and Fitting which I read during the intermissions. This odd combo of romance and modal logic perhaps is what lead me to spend the majority of the third act ignoring the dramatic breakup Mimi and Rodolfo and instead thinking about a formal definition for a notion of true love.

# A Working Definition For True Love

In order to formalize true love, we need a working definition. While there
are many definitions of love, we want one which characterizes some notion of *true* love, something beyond just physical attraction or physical attraction. For this we take a somewhat not immediately obvious turn to theology, where we will find what a working definition of love to build our theory off of.
One of god's many ascribed properties beyond *Omniscience* (all knowing), *Omnipotence* (all powerful), is being "all loving" which we will refer to as *Omniamance*. 
{{< notice note >}}
*Omniamance* is my attempt at properly forming this word inline with Omniscience and Omnipotence from the latin [*amans*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/amans). Perhaps we could also use *Omniamorous*, but we find the alignment to words *Monogamous* and *Polyamorous*, which use love in a suggestive sense risk adding an undesirable connotation to the more *Agápe* interpretation used when one says god is all loving.
{{< /notice >}}
The love of *Omniamance* takes a form of love called [*Agápe*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agape) love. There are a few characterizations of this form of love but we will use Thomas Aquinas' interpretation that to love in this way is to "will the good of the other".

This definition extends well beyond the theological; It is very pragmatic as well. It captures
the form of sacrificial love parents should have for their children and spouses should have for 
each other, that abstract the willingness to "take a bullet" for each other to ensure the wellbeing of
the other. Now to formalize this we will in turn formalize each part.
