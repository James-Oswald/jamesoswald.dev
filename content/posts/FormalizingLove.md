### Background
Recently I attended my first opera, a showing of *La bohème* at the Metropolitan. While I wasn't supper impressed with the plot, I brought a copy of *First-Order Modal Logic* by Mendelsohn and Fitting which I read during the intermissions. This odd combo of romance and modal logic perhaps is what lead me to spend the majority of the third act ignoring the dramatic breakup Mimi and Rodolfo and instead
thinking about a formal definition for a notion of love.

# A Working Definition For Love

While perhaps not immediately obvious, there is a strong tie in from theology which we will adopt for our 
working definition of love and build our theory off of.
One of god's many ascribed properties beyond *Omniscience* (all knowing), *Omnipotence* (all powerful), is 
being "all loving" which we will refer to as *Omniamance*.
{{< notice note >}}
*Omniamance* is my attempt at properly forming this word inline with Omniscience and Omnipotence from the latin [*amans*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/amans). Perhaps we could also use *Omniamorous*, but we find the alignment to words *Monogamous* and *Polyamorous*, which use love in a suggestive sense risk adding an undesirable connotation to the more [*Agápe*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agape) interpretation used when one says god is all loving.
