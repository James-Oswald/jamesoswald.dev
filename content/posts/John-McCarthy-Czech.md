## Background
Recently, I was going down the rabbit hole on [John McCarthy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCarthy_(computer_scientist)), best known to me as the inventor of the [Situation Calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation_calculus) but more widely know for the creation the LISP family of programming languages and his folk designation as one of the "founding fathers" of artificial intelligence. While digging into him, I came across a very interesting letter sent to (and later released by) his coworker at Stanford, [Les Ernest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Earnest). The letter regards a visit by John McCarthy to Czechoslovakia in the months following the its [invasion by the Warsaw Pact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw_Pact_invasion_of_Czechoslovakia). Ernest considered the letter to reflect a pivotal moment in McCarthy's life, and perhaps a cause of a later shift in his politics. Regardless of Ernest's claims on the significance of the letter, it serves as an interesting primary account of McCarthy's inner feelings and the feelings expressed by various Czech researchers regarding the invasion.  

Ernest released the letter in McCarthy's cursive handwriting. As as someone who does not frequently read cursive I found the letter difficult to get through so first transcribed it for myself. I release my transcription here with some annotations in hopes to help other people who find his handwriting a bit difficult to read. My transcription may contain mistakes, feel free to reach out if you catch one so I may correct it. Particular items I was unsure about are footnoted.

## Some Notes Regarding my Posting of the Letter
The full text of the letter in McCarthy's original handwriting is available from the Internet Archive [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20230607162119/https://web.stanford.edu/~learnest/jmc/czech.pdf). I am not sure when Ernest released the letter to the public, the Internet Archive shows it being available as early as 2014 on [Ernest's Stanford homepage](http://web.archive.org/web/20141025061526/http://web.stanford.edu/~learnest/). Note that McCarthy explicitly states at the end of the letter  
> You can show this letter to people but don’t post it on a bulletin board or allow any part of it to be quoted in print.   

Now, 56 years later, with both the sender and recipient dead, as well as Ernest's posting of the original to his website ~10 years ago, I conster my posting this transcription to be fair game. Personally, I feel it has entered the realm of being a historical primary source.

# The Letter

{{< notice notice >}}

Things that I am not confident of my transcription of I place in square brackets \[...\]. Sometime I will footnote with a Transcription note if I find it to be important. Footnotes are placed after each major paragraph and the count resets (to allow for the easy introduction of more in the future if necessary)

Nov 1, 1968  
Vienna

Dear Les,  
I had quite an interesting visit to Czechoslovakia. First there were two days in [Prague](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague), then a car trip to [Bratislava](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bratislava), then a visit to their Institute of Technical Cybernetics$^1$, then a long weekend in the [Tatra mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatra_Mountains) (Monday was a holiday, the 50th anniversary of Czechoslovakia), and then they drove me to Vienna where I have been IBMing. Details:

I was met at Prague airport (saw about 5 big Russian helicopters) by [Ivan Plander](https://www.computer.org/profiles/ivan-plander)$^2$ from above mentioned Bratislava Institute. No questions, no baggage inspection from customs. 4 hours late on account of London fog so direct to hotel. Travelog concerned August; here is [Wenceslaus square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wenceslas_Square)$^3$ where demonstration held, one or more students shot, see bullet scars on museum building, see flowers in front of statue in square, see burned out radio building. Next day visited Institute of Technical Information -- \[borers\]$^4$. Met Culik$^5$ and \[Bechvan\]$^6$ from mathematical institute; they are very smart but work on semi-\[boring\]$^4$ problems (Complexity of Turing machines), dinner in former monastery, talked politics till 10, then on my initiative to rock music club full of teenagers & college students. That day a disk jockey played mostly American soul, no West Coast music, some British. Very slick pattern. He told me he knew and liked the West Coast stuff but didn’t consider it danceable enough for this club. He gets most of his records on trips to west by cadging them from record company sales executives. No light show, though some were advertised on posters - as well as live bands with English names but apparently either local or from West Germany.

$^1$: There does not seem to be many online records of the Institute of Technical Cybernetics at Bratislava. I was only able to dig up [this note](https://www.sav.sk/?lang=en&doc=ins-org-ins&institute_no=60) which mentions that the Institute of Informatics of the Slovak academy of sciences came out of the Laboratory of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics, which became the Institute of Technical Cybernetics in 1966, which later became the Institute of Computer Systems in 1991, and finally the Institute of Informatics in 1999.   
$^2$: Plander at time of writing is still alive.  
$^3$: This is misspelled by in the letter.  
$^4$: This stands out as quite a comment. It is very possible "borers" and "boring" are wrong; both words start with the same 3 cursive letters. My original reading was even more controversial: "losers" and "semi-losing problems" which is hard to believe but possible, the "r" looks much more like an "s" in both. He later uses the same word in the next paragraph to describe the Bratislava Institute as "non-loser/borer."   
$^5$: I believe this to be [Karel Culik](https://dblp.org/pid/24/5814.html), but it may also be [Karel Culik II](https://dblp.org/pid/c/KarelCulikII.html), they both worked on turing machines.  
$^6$: I am unable to figure out who this is. Many permutations of the name tried.

On the way to Bratislava we found ourselves scooting in and out of Russian truck convoys heading east. The way is incredibly full of detours, all two lane and at one point we got lost along with several Russian trucks and a car from Holland. Our driver found his way back, don’t know about others. At one point, all vehicles were stopped by some bottleneck ahead and Petraš$^1$, director of Slovak institute$^1$, got into conversation with Russian officers who complained about postal service because his aunt who lived in western Czechoslovakia had not answered his letters. The Slovaks could think of another reason why his letters went unanswered.

$^1$ I'm unable to find any references to this individual, and it is not clear to me if the Slovak Institute is referring to one of the many Slovak institutes outside of Czechoslovakia during this time period or an institution within the country. Based on later comments I assume he is internal, but all I can concretely say is that he is not [listed as a former director of the Slovak Institute in Ohio](http://www.slovakinstitute.com/Directors.htm).

The Institute of Technical Cybernetics in Bratislava is on the whole a non-[loser]$^1$. Its projects look like they might succeed and could be useful if they did. They are designing a 17-bit computer for process control and possibly time sharing to be built out of Czech TTL. If D. Poole$^2$ wants an adventure they would be glad to have help.

Czechoslovak scientific institutions have cut all their contacts with the Russians and other eastern countries that invaded them. They are eager for scientific connections with the West. Petraš even asked if they could get subcontracts to do programming or hardware design. This might be worth thinking about for programming firms or outfits like III$^3$ because wages and overhead are low and the cream of talent might be available for skimming.

$^1$ See footnote 4 for paragraph 1. 
$^2$ Dave W. Poole, a member of McCarthy's Stanford AI lab. Seems to have no publications, although he appears frequently doing experiments in [their archives](https://www.fromthepage.com/paged_search/poole-102249). A picture of him can be found as #38 [here](http://infolab.stanford.edu/pub/voy/museum/pictures/AIlab/list.html). Not to be confused with the more famous AI researcher [David Poole](https://dblp.org/pid/p/DavidPoole.html). 
$^3$: Probably referring to [Information International, Inc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_International,_Inc.)

The trip to Tatras took 3 days, one each way driving over very bad roads. Once there the trails and \[woods and rocks\]$^1$ looked exactly like Sierras. In fact when the trail bent right over a wooden bridge, I half expected to see

$^1$: This is almost certainly wrong.
