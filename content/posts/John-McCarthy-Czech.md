## Background
Recently, I was going down the rabbit hole on [John McCarthy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCarthy_(computer_scientist)), best known to me as the inventor of the [Situation Calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation_calculus) but more widely know for the creation the LISP family of programming languages and his folk designation as one of the "founding fathers" of artificial intelligence. While digging into him, I came across a very interesting letter sent to (and later released by) his coworker at Stanford, [Les Ernest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Earnest). The letter regards a visit by John McCarthy to Czechoslovakia in the months following the its [invasion by the Warsaw Pact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw_Pact_invasion_of_Czechoslovakia). Ernest considered the letter to reflect a pivotal moment in McCarthy's life, and perhaps a cause of a later shift in his politics. Regardless of Ernest's claims on the significance of the letter, it serves as an interesting primary account of McCarthy's inner feelings and the feelings expressed by various Czech researchers regarding the invasion.  

Ernest released the letter in McCarthy's cursive handwriting. As as someone who does not frequently read cursive I found the letter difficult to get through so first transcribed it for myself. I release my transcription here with some annotations in hopes to help other people who find his handwriting a bit difficult to read. My transcription may contain mistakes, feel free to reach out if you catch one so I may correct it. Particular items I was unsure about are footnoted.

## Some Notes Regarding my Posting of the Letter
The full text of the letter in McCarthy's original handwriting is available from the Internet Archive [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20230607162119/https://web.stanford.edu/~learnest/jmc/czech.pdf). I am not sure when Ernest released the letter to the public, the Internet Archive shows it being available as early as 2014 on [Ernest's Stanford homepage](http://web.archive.org/web/20141025061526/http://web.stanford.edu/~learnest/). Note that McCarthy explicitly states at the end of the letter  
> You can show this letter to people but don’t post it on a bulletin board or allow any part of it to be quoted in print.   

Now, 56 years later, with both the sender and recipient dead, as well as Ernest's posting of the original to his website ~10 years ago, I conster my posting this transcription to be fair game. Personally, I feel it has entered the realm of being a historical primary source.

# The Letter
Nov 1, 1968  
Vienna

Dear Les,  
I had quite an interesting visit to Czechoslovakia. First there were two days in [Prague](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague), then a car trip to [Bratislava](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bratislava), then a visit to their Institute of Technical Cybernetics[^1], then a long weekend in the [Tatra mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatra_Mountains) (Monday was a holiday, the 50th anniversary of Czechoslovakia), and then they drove me to Vienna where I have been IBMing. Details:

I was met at Prague airport (saw about 5 big Russian helicopters) by [Ivan Plander](https://www.computer.org/profiles/ivan-plander)[^2] from above mentioned Bratislava Institute. No questions, no baggage inspection from customs. 4 hours late on account of London fog so direct to hotel. Travelog concerned August; here is Wenceslaus square[^3] where demonstration held, one or more students shot, see bullet scars on museum building, see flowers in front of statue in square, see burned out radio building. Next day visited Institute of Technical Information -- losers. Met Culik[^4] and \[Bechvan\][\^5] from mathematical institute; they are very smart but work on semi-boring problems (Complexity of Turing machines), dinner in former monastery, talked politics till 10, then on my initiative to rock music club full of teenagers & college students. That day a disk jockey played mostly American soul, no West Coast music, some British. Very slick pattern. He told me he knew and liked the West Coast stuff but didn’t consider it danceable enough for this club. He gets most of his records on trips to west by cadging them from record company sales executives. No light show, though some were advertised on posters - as well as live bands with English names but apparently either local or from West Germany. 

[^1]: There does not seem to be many online records of the Institute of Technical Cybernetics at Bratislava. I was only able to dig up [this note](https://www.sav.sk/?lang=en&doc=ins-org-ins&institute_no=60) which mentions that the Institute of Informatics of the Slovak academy of sciences came out of the Laboratory of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics, which became the Institute of Technical Cybernetics in 1966, which later became the Institute of Computer Systems in 1991, and finally the Institute of Informatics in 1999.   
[^2]: Plander at time of writing is still alive.
