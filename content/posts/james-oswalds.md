I frequently find myself reminded by Google that I am not the most prominent individual named James Oswald on the internet,
nor am I even the most prominent James T. Oswald. In this post I will enumerate the James Oswalds of the
world in 2024 who are more prominent then me. If you are also a James Oswald, and wish to have yourself added to this list, please [reach out](/contact) and I will add you to the list. Note that this list includes both living and dead James Oswalds. 

# \[1\] James Oswald (Scottish Writer and Farmer) Alive
By far the most prominent James Oswald alive today is James Oswald the scottish crime writer and farmer. He has written a number of well renown book series, foremost of which is his *Inspector McLean* series. In his free time he runs a 350 acre farm in scotland and raises very cool looking cows!

# \[2\] James Oswald (Scottish Composer) 1710–1769
This James Oswald deserves to have a book written about him due to the interesting life he lived. Not only was he a member of a secret music society of composers, "The Temple of Apollo", but he also eloped from Edinburgh to London with his wife. He was popular enough that a prominent poet, [Allan Ramsay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_Ramsay_(poet)), was sad about him leaving and wrote the following poem about him. 
that they wrote about it in  
> ‘Dear Oswald, could my verse as sweetly flow  
> As notes thou softly touchest with the bow,  
> When all the circling fair attentive hing  
> On ilk vibration of thy trembling string,  
> I’d sing how thou wouldst melt our souls away  
> By solemn notes, or cheer us with the gay,  
> In verse as lasting as thy tune shall be,  
> As soft as thy new polish’d “Danton me.”  
>   --An excerpt from Allan Ramsay's "An Epistle to James Oswald"
