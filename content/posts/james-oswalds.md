In this post I enumerate the James Oswalds of the world in May 2024 who show up above me on Google search results, as well as Google Scholar. Note that this list includes both living and dead James Oswalds. 

# (1) James Oswald (Scottish Writer and Farmer) Alive
By far the most prominent James Oswald alive today is James Oswald the scottish crime writer and farmer. He has written a number of well renown book series, foremost of which is his *Inspector McLean* series. In his free time he runs a 350 acre farm in scotland and raises very cool looking cows!

# (2) James Oswald (Scottish Composer) 1710–1769
This James Oswald deserves to have a book written about him due to the interesting life he lived. Not only was he a member of a secret music society of composers, "The Temple of Apollo", but he also eloped from Edinburgh to London with his wife. He was popular enough that a prominent poet, [Allan Ramsay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_Ramsay_(poet)), was sad about him leaving and wrote the following poem about him:
> ‘Dear Oswald, could my verse as sweetly flow  
> As notes thou softly touchest with the bow,  
> When all the circling fair attentive hing  
> On ilk vibration of thy trembling string,  
> I’d sing how thou wouldst melt our souls away  
> By solemn notes, or cheer us with the gay,  
> In verse as lasting as thy tune shall be,  
> As soft as thy new polish’d “Danton me.”  
>   --An excerpt from Allan Ramsay's "An Epistle to James Oswald"

# (3) James Oswald Scottish Political Dynasty (1650 - 1814)
This James Oswald family line all served as British MPs. 
* James Oswald The Elder (1650 - 1716)
* James Oswald The Younger (1715 - 1769)
* James Townsend Oswald (1748 - 1814)   

James Oswald the Elder was the grandfather of James Oswald The Younger who was the father to James Townsend Oswald.
I sure feel bad for James Oswald, the link between James Oswald the Elder and James Oswald The Younger. He is lost to this blog post for not being prominent enough to make it onto Google. These three did too much to comment on in this post, but they all lived very interesting lives, you can read about them on Wikipedia. Some highlights are:
* James Oswald The Younger was good friends with famous enlightenment thinkers David Hume and Adam Smith. 
* James Townsend Oswald lost his seat in parliament due to bribery, ending the James Oswald MP Dynasty. His son [General John Oswald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Oswald_(British_Army_officer)) tried to run but lost.
* James Townsend Oswald's daughter married [Thomas Bruce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Bruce,_7th_Earl_of_Elgin), the brains behind the taking of the [Elgin Marbles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elgin_Marbles)(sculptures from the Parthenon and Acropolis of Athens) from Greece for the British Museum.
